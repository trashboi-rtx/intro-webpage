	<font size = "5" face = "Helvetica"> My name is Eric Carpenter. I am currently a senior at UK studying ICT with a minor in history. I was born here in Kentucky but spent most of my live living in Floresville, Texas. In my spare time I enjoy working on technology-related projects and playing Euro Truck Simulator 2.</font><br>
